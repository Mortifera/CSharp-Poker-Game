# CSharp-Poker-Game

This poker game was a cumulative project for my object-oriented programming course. It is a simple .NET console application that makes use of enums and interfaces.



I improved the project by adding additional checks for different poker hands (the original project only checked for flushes) and placing those checks in a different class.
