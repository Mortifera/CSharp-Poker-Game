# CSharp-Poker-Game
This poker game was a cumulative project for my object-oriented programming course. It is a simple .NET console application that makes use of enums and interfaces.

I improved the project by adding additional checks for different poker hands (the original project only checked for flushes) and placing those checks in a different class. I also improved the code for sorting using lambda expressions as the original project sorted by suit and then by rank.

## Playing The Game 
To play the game you need to [download](https://github.com/asathkumara/CSharp-Poker-Game/releases/tag/v1.0) the release, extract it and run the setup.exe file.
