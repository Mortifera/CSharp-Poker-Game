# CSharp-Poker-Game
This poker game was a final project for my object-oriented programming course. It is a simple .NET framework console application that makes use of enums and interfaces.

I improved the original project by adding and consolidating additional checks for different poker hands (the original project only checked for flushes). I also improved the underlying structure of the code and incorporated some unit tests. I'm still working on additional refactorings.

## Playing The Game 
To play the game you need to [download](https://github.com/asathkumara/CSharp-Poker-Game/releases/download/v1.0/CSharp-Poker-Game-v1.0.zip) the release, extract it and run the setup.exe file.
